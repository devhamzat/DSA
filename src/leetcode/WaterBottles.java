Thought process
first things first, we have two integers 
that determine the amount of water bottle you can drink.numBottles and numExchange
so basically if numBottles = 10, and numExchange = 2,
this means that you can exchange 2 empty bottles for one full bottle
so;first 10= 5 exchangable , after second 5 =2 exchangeable, after third 2 =1 exchangeable
after fourth 1 (bring back the one empty from the 2 exchangeable)so 2 = 1 exchangeable
therefore  10+5+2+2+1=20 possible number of water you can drink
BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION
have a variable for the amount of bottles
initialize it with the numbottles
then have a variable for empty bottles
initalize it with the

public class WaterBottles {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {

        return 0;

    }
